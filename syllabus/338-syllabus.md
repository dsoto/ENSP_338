## Course Description
An overview of energy management approaches in residential and
commercial settings that involve electrical devices, including lighting,
motors, and HVAC. Fundamentals of electricity, electric power delivery,
and the workings of common appliances; energy economics.


## Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply principles of electricity
- Exposure to existing electricity infrastructure
- Calculate cost and energy impacts of electrical efficiency measures


## Course Requirements
This course assumes a solid background in algebra, trigonometric
functions, and physics.  There will be biweekly homework assignments
that will have both quantitative and qualitative tasks.  Students should
come to class having completed the assigned reading and be ready to perform
guided problem solving during class.  Students will complete a research
project at the end of the class and give a written report and
presentation that integrates what they have learned in the class.


## Grading
- Classroom work (quizzes, participation) 25%
- Homework 25%
- Midterm 20%
- Research project 10%
- Final exam 20%


## Agreements
- Respectful tone in classroom

Civility is required from all students during discussions and
interactions.  In general, I expect students to be supportive of each
others learning goals.

- Minimize electronic distractions

Internet-connected electronic devices (phones, tablets) may be used in
class for learning purposes.  Using devices for social networks or other
uses during class time is strongly discouraged.

## Readings

The required text for this course is:

Gil Masters, *Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems*, 2nd
Edition.  Available at the Campus Bookstore and at Northlight Books.
There is also an online version of the text available on the Sonoma
Library website.

There will also be readings posted to Moodle throughout the
semester.  Graded reflection assignments will be assigned for posted
readings and will be included in your homework grading average.

## Homework

You will be graded both on the
validity of your work as well as your ability to communicate your
methods.  This means that in addition to the mathematics, you should be
providing brief explanations of your techniques and your thought
process.  Calculations without supporting arguments will not receive
full credit.

Homework will be graded on a coarse grading schedule of a 1, 2, or 3.  A
3 is given for strong work that meets or exceeds the requirements, a 2
for adequate work, and a 1 for work that doesn't meet expectations.
After grading, you may submit a self-evaluation that considers how your
approach differs from the accepted approach.  Self-evaluations that
demonstrate an improvement in your understanding will raise your
homework grade through partial credit.


Here is the tentative homework schedule.

We will solve problems in class that I hand out.  These are graded
credit no credit.  If you have an unexcused absence on that day, you
will receive a no credit grade for that days work.

## Office Hours

My office hours are held Tuesday and Wednesday in my office in Rachel
Carson Hall 12 from 2pm until 3pm.  Signup is online and can be accessed
through my website at http://danielrsoto.com
