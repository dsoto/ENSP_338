- Real elements (heaters, filaments, batteries) are represented as ideal
  models

## Example
- Simple light
- Sketch physical representation
- Sketch wiring diagram
- Sketch schematic
- Apply mathematical models
<!-- sketch on paper in notes -->

## Ideal Voltage Source
- An ideal voltage source can deliver any amount of current while
  holding its voltage constant.
- ![](../figures/ideal_voltage_source.jpg)

## Ideal Resistor
An ideal resistor obeys Ohm's Law, $V=IR$
![](../figures/ideal_resistor.jpg)

## Ohm's Law
$$ V = IR $$
The current in a resistor is proportional to the voltage across it.
The constant of proportionality is the resistance.

## Ideal Current Source
- An ideal current source delivers a fixed amount of current no matter
  the voltage at its terminals
- ![](../figures/ideal_current_source.jpg)


## Kirchhoff's Current Law
- The sum of currents flowing into a node must equal the sum of the
  currents leaving the node at any instant.
- Water flow or automobile traffic provide some intuition.

## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law
- The sum of the voltages around any loop of a circuit at any instant is
  zero.
- Hiking a trail provides some intuition.

## Equivalent resistances
- We can use Ohm's Law and Kirchoff's Laws to determine an equivalent
  resistance to model a network of resistors.

## Resistors in series
- Resistors in series have the same current flowing through each one
![](../figures/resistors_series.jpg)

## Resistors in parallel
- Resistors in parallel have the same voltage across their terminals
- ![](../figures/resistors_parallel.jpg)

## Relationship to energy
- One coulomb of charge raised to a potential of one volt gains one
  Joule of energy

## Relationship to power
- Voltage is energy per charge
- Current is charge per time
- Voltage times current has units of energy per time or power
- $\frac{energy}{charge} \cdot \frac{charge}{time}$
- $P = VI$

## Power
$$ P = VI $$
The power dissipated by a device is equal to the voltage across it
multiplied by the current flowing through it.

## Voltage and current directions

## Delivered power
- Power delivered by an ideal voltage source
<!-- written -->

## Consumed power
- Power consumed by an ideal resistor
<!-- written -->

## Energy
- The energy consumed is equal to the power multiplied by the time.
- The energy unit we use is kWh (kilowatt-hour)
- A 1 kW device consuming power for 1 hour uses 1 kWh of electricity

## Tariff
- The utility charges proportional to the amount of kWh consumed
- Some consumers are also charged according to the maximum power
  observed

## Wire resistance
- Resistivity - property of the material - intensive
- Resistance - property of the wire - extensive

## Wire resistance

$$R = resistivity \cdot \frac{length}{area}$$
$$R = \rho \frac{l}{A}$$

- The resistance of a wire is proportional to
    - the resistivity of the material
    - the length of the wire
- It is inversely proportional to
    - the cross-sectional area

## Units
- To get proper units of resistance in ohms
- Resistivity is expressed in Ohm/meter
- Length in meters
- Area in square meters

## Informal poll
Would you rather have

- $1K now or $500 in a year?
- $1K now or $1K in a year?
- $1K now or $2K in a year?
- $1K now or $5K in a year?
- $1K now or $10K in a year?

<!--
questions for class
- why do you have these preferences
- how do we quantify these preferences?
-->

## Equivalence principle
- Given a choice between money now and money later, most demand a larger
  value if money is provided at a later date

<!--
this is as much art as science
-->

## Loans
- With a loan we essentially rent money and pay a percentage of the
  amount we still owe the lender

## Discount rate based on equivalence principle
- Banks have preferences that set their loan rates
- People have preferences that dictate their discount rate


## Discount Rate and Net Present Value
$$\textrm{Present Value (USD)} =
\frac
{\textrm{Future Amount (USD)}}
{(1 + \textrm{Discount Rate})^{\textrm{number of years}} }$$

$$P = \frac {F} {(1 + i)^{n} }$$

{(1 + \textrm{Rate})^{\textrm{number of years}} }$$

<!-- what was the point of yesterday's spreadsheet demo? -->

## Activity
- What is the present value of a $1000 payment 5 years from now with an
  interest rate of 10%?


## Strategy

<!-- 1000 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $620.92 -->

## Activity

  interest?

## Strategy

<!-- 1000 * (1 + 0.07)^10 = 1967.15 -->

<!-- does anyone remember from the reading what NPV is -->

# Net Present Value (NPV)


## Net Present Value
- Provides a shorthand to calculate the present value of a stream of
payments.
- Provides a method of comparison for two different cash flows
- Cash flows can be compared for equivalence

<!-- do I have some cash flow plots or diagrams? -->

## Cash flow
- We think of discrete events in time where cash is paid or recieved

## Two options
![](../figures/two-option-cash-flow.pdf)

## Present Value

Single payment
$$ PV = \frac{C}{(1+i)^n} $$

Stream of payments
$$ PV = C_0 +
        \frac{C_1}{1+i} +
        \frac{C_2}{(1+i)^2} +
        \dots +
        \frac{C_N}{(1+i)^N}$$

Compact notation
$$ PV = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n}$$

## Two options
![](../figures/two-option-cash-flow.pdf)


# Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

## Internal Rate of Return
- Tells us at what interest rate a cash flow has a net present value of
  zero
- We will look at this on a spreadsheet

# Capital Recovery Function

## Capital Recovery Function
Tells you how much the loan payment is for a given balance, number of
payments, and interest rate.

## Capital Recovery Factor

$$CRF = \frac {i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1}$$

## Review


## Measuring energy

If power is constant, we multiply the power by the time

$$E = P \cdot t$$


## Measuring energy

If the power is not constant we break it up using a graph, a
spreadsheet, or calculus.

![](../figures/power-time-series.pdf)

## Average loads

The average load $P_{avg}$ is the equivalent constant power that will yield the
same energy as a varying load over the same time period.

$$ E = P_{avg} \cdot t = \int P dt = \textrm{Total Energy} $$


## Tiered charge

See written notes

<!-- show that area has dimensions of money -->

## ENSP 338, Lecture  9, Conserved cost of energy
### Professor Daniel Soto, Sonoma State University
### Monday, 22 Sep 2014



## Announcements
- Quiz Wednesday
- No class on Oct 13th



<!-- when we have time, illustrate charges graphically -->

<!--
- pre lecture checklist
- previous materials from lecture bank
- previous written material
-->

## Learning Objectives
- Use conserved cost of energy as an investment metric

## Activity Objective
- Be able to use NPV, IRR, and CCE on calculator and computer

## Review
- How did we determine the cost of a loan?
- What were our methods?



## Capital Recovery Factor (CRF)
- Allows for the calculation of the annual or monthly payment to repay a
  loan

$$CRF = \frac {i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1}$$

## Monthly payments

If payments are monthly, we divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by
12 and multiply the number of years ($n$) by 12.

$$CRF = \frac {i(1+i/12)^{12n}}{(1+i/12)^{12n}-1}$$


## Exercise
- What is the annual payment for a $10K loan with an interest rate of 5%
  paid over a period of 7 years?

## Solution
![](../figures/capital_recovery_factor.jpg)

## Exercise
- What is the CRF for a 10 year loan at 0% interest?

## Solution
- 0.10 or 10%

## Cost of conserved energy
- Allows you to calculate the value of an investment as a per kWh cost
- This allows easy comparison with the current or plausible future cost
  of electricity



## CCE (Meier 1984)

$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Investment}}{\textrm{Annual Energy Savings}}
\cdot
\frac{d}{1-(1+d)^{-n}}
$$

## Interpreting the CCE
$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Investment}}{\textrm{Annual Energy Savings}}
\cdot
\frac{i}{1-(1+i)^{-n}}
\cdot
\frac{(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n}
$$

$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Investment}}{\textrm{Annual Energy Savings}}
\cdot
\frac{i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n - 1}
$$

$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Investment}\cdot\textrm{CRF}}{\textrm{Annual Energy Savings}}
$$



## Cost of avoided carbon
- Allows you to calculate the value of an investment as the cost per
  amount of carbon not emitted
- Allows comparison with the current market price of carbon

## Announcements
- ENSP Applications open today
- Quiz today
- Sign up for outline feedback partners
- Outside project resources from area agencies

## Learning Objectives
- Understand RMS power
- Gain familiarity with new elements, inductors and capacitors

## RMS Power
We have a resistor connected to a sinusoidal voltage source and express
the voltage as a cosine.
$$ V = V_p \cos \omega t $$
The current is given by Ohm's Law.
$$ I = V / R = V_p / R \cos \omega t $$
The power is given by the product of the voltage and the current.
$$ P = VI = V_p^2 / R \cos^2 \omega t $$

## RMS Power
$$ P = VI = \frac{V_p^2}{ R} \cos^2 \omega t $$
This is rapidly changing in time from 0 to $\frac{V_p^2}{R}$.  What is
the average power?

## Learning Objectives
- Understand phase shift between voltage and current for reactive loads
- How does Ohm's Law change for reactive loads?
- Transformers
- Real, reactive, apparent power

## Guiding Questions
- Why does the utility charge extra for power factor?

## Review
- Power consumption in resistors and capacitors
- Quiz 2 Review

## Generalizing Ohm's Law
- If we incorporate complex ($\sqrt{-1}$) numbers, we can use Ohm's Law
  to find the currents and voltages in inductors and capacitors

## Complex Impedance
- This is an extension of ohms law
- $V = IR$
- $V = IZ$
- $Z = V/I$
- What if voltage and current are out of phase?
- We use complex numbers to express the phase differences

## Imaginary numbers

## Complex Impedance
- Same rules for series and parallel apply
- However, now we use complex numbers

##
![](../figures/complex_impedance.jpg)



## Capacitors
- Store energy in an electric field
- Current proportional to the rate of change of voltage
- Cannot change voltage instantaneously
- Acts like a spring

## Inductors
- Store energy in a magnetic field
- Voltage is proportional to the rate of change of current
- Cannot change current instantaneously
- Acts like a flywheel

## Power
- We see that these devices consume no power but still require current
- Supplying this current consumes energy in the transmission lines and
  distribution system
- Utilities want to deliver the minumum amount of current to give you
  your power.

## Key point
- Even though power isn't being consumed, current is being delivered
- Utility must be able to provide for peak current
- Utility is only compensated for provinging amps

## Does the utility like a stadium?

## Does the utility like a huge inductor or huge capacitor?

## Motors
- Act like inductors
- Inductive loads create unnecessary extra current on the lines

## Transformers
![Idealized Transformer](../figures/transformer_diagram.pdf)

- The ratio of voltages is equal to the ratio of turns of wire on the
  transformer sides

## Transformer Current and Voltage

# Three phase power

## Three phase power
- Power sent over three wires
- Each wire is 120 degrees out of phase with the others
- For balanced loads, total power transmitted is constant
- For balanced loads, no return wire needed

    - For balanced loads, currents sum to zero
- Power delivery is constant over time
    - Allows for smoother operation of machines

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic principles of electricity to light conversion

## Guiding Questions
- What is the least amount of electricity/carbon we can use to get the
  visibility we need?

## Review

# Light generation and Spectra

## Photon Emission
- Light is generated when an electron changes its energy level
- The energy of the photon emitted is the difference in this energy
  level

## Photon Emission
![](../figures/photon-emission.jpg)

## Electromagnetic spectrum
- Radiowaves, visible light, and x-rays are all electromagnetic
  radiation
- The only difference between these is the frequency and wavelength of
  the radiation

## Electromagnetic spectrum
- Under some conditions materials emit a continuous spectrum
- Under other conditions materials emit a discrete spectrum

## Visible spectrum
- Visible light is only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum
- Ultraviolet light and infrared radiation are the wavelengths just
  outside our visible range
- When we perceive white light, it is because multiple colors of light
  are present
- It is a difficult problem to create the right balance of color to find a
  white that people find appealing

## Visible spectrum
![](../figures/spectrum-2.jpg)


## Thermal and spectral emission
![](../figures/spectrum-3.jpg)


## Eye spectrum response
- The rods and cones in our eyes are tuned to detect certain colors or wavelengths of light

## Eye spectrum response
![](../figures/eye-sensitivity.jpg)


## Blackbody spectrum
- Used to approximate lighting spectra
- Is a good model for many hot objects
- You may have seen the Stefan-Boltzmann law $P=A\epsilon\sigma T^4$ in your thermal class


## Blackbodies
![Black body spectrum](../figures/color-temp-4.png)

## Solar Spectrum
- The light we are most accustomed to is the sun
- The sun can be modeled as a black body at a temperature of about 5800 Kelvin


## Solar Spectrum
![](../figures/spectrum-solar.png)


# Illumination Units

## Luminous flux
## Illuminance
## Luminance
## Luminous intensity

## Review of units
- We need units to express solid angles
- We start by reviewing the radian

## Radians
- The radian is defined as the arc length of an angle divided by its radius
- The radian is the most natural unit of angle
- The circumference of a circle is $2 \pi r$ so there are $2 \pi$ radians in a circle
- $2 \pi$ (6.28) radians = 360 degrees
- [Radian GIF Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian#mediaviewer/File:Circle_radians.gif)

## Solid Angle
- The Steradian is the unit of measure
- Now we have a solid angle or cone
- The steradian is the surface area of the spherical surface divided by the radius squared
- The area of a sphere $4 \pi r^2$ so there are $4 \pi$ steradians in a sphere


## Solid angle
![](../figures/steradian-wikipedia.png)

## Radiometric Quantities
- Purely based on the energy content
- Radiant flux or radiant power (Watts)
- Irradiance (Watts per square meter)

## Photopic Quantities
- Based on the energy content and our perception
- Luminous flux
- Illuminance
- Luminous intensity
- Luminous energy

## Luminous flux
- Lumens
- Light bulbs are about 500-2000 lumens
- The radiant power weighted by the the photopic luminosity function
- Can think of as "eye watts"
- Most relevant measure for a lightbulb's total output

## Illuminance
- Lux - lumen per square meter
- Luminous flux per unit area
- Most relevant measure for a workspace

## Luminous intensity
- Candela - lumens per steradian
- Also candlepower

## Luminous energy
- Luminous flux times time
- Lumen second
- Kilolumen hour


## Units
- Lux, illuminance, luminous flux per unit area, lumen per square meter
- Lumen, luminous flux
- Candela, luminous intensity, lumen per steradian
- Candela, 1 candlepower = 0.981 candela
- Foot-Candle, lm/ft^2, 10.76 lux = 1 foot-candle
