## Exercise 2

## Line voltage drop
- We use voltage dividers to estimate power loss in wiring

## Exercise 3

## Exercise 4

## High Voltage Distribution
- Feeding loads at higher voltage reduces line losses
- This is a square law decrease

## Wire resistance
- Resistivity - property of the material - intensive
- Resistance - property of the wire - extensive

## Wire resistance
- The resistance of a wire is proportional to
    - the resistivity of the material
    - the length of the wire
- It is inversely proportional to
    - the cross-sectional area
- $$R = resistivity \cdot \frac{length}{area}$$
- $$R = \rho \frac{l}{A}$$

## Units
- To get proper units of resistance in ohms
- Resistivity is expressed in Ohm/meter
- Length in meters
- Area in square meters

## Exercise 5
- Calculate the resistance of 1 kilometer of 12 AWG Wire
