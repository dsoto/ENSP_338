## Learning objectives
- You will understand and apply basic principles of electricity
- You will learn to use models to simplify complex problems and make
  accurate estimates
- You will calculate cost and energy impacts of electrical efficiency
  measures
- You will learn to research new options for efficiency savings.

<!--

## Basic principles of electricity
- Ohms Law
- Electromagnetic Induction
- Alternating Current

## Model thinking
- A model is an approximation that allows us to understand and make
  predictions about a system
- All are models are wrong, some are useful
- How do you separate the important factors in a model from the less
  significant?
- How do you determine which models to use?

<!--
- ohms law describes the behavior of avogadros number of electrons
-->

## Research skills
- How do you discover more about a topic?
- How do you synthesize this information to answer a question?
- How do you find the right question to ask?

# Introduction

## Introduction
- Why is this topic important?
- Electricity is a significant energy use in our society
- Electricity is primarily generated with coal which creates climate
  risk and health impacts
