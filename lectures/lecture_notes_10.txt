# Review

## Review
- Sinusoids
- Complex numbers
- Phasor representation
- Resistors on AC
- Capacitors

## Complex numbers
- Possess magnitude and phase making them a natural fit for expressing
  the relationship between sinusoids of the same frequency

# Complex Impedance

## Complex Impedance
- $Z = R + jX$
- $X = X_L - X_C$
- $X = \omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C}$

## Complex Impedance
- This is an extension of ohms law
- $V = IR$
- $V = IZ$
- $Z = V/I$
- What if voltage and current are out of phase?
- We use complex numbers to express the phase differences

## Complex Impedance
- Same rules for series and parallel apply
- However, now we use complex numbers

# Inductors

## Inductor
- Storage device
- Stores energy in a magnetic field
- Behavior depends on frequency
- Ideal inductor consumes no power

## Inductor
![](./figures/sjsu_inductor.jpg)

## Inductor
- Expressed in units of Henries

## Inductors
- The voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current.
- v = L di/dt

## Exercise
- Attach a 10 millihenry inductor to a 120 Volt RMS source represented
  as $170 \cos 377 t$
- Sketch the voltage waveform
- Sketch the current waveform based on the $V = L di/dt$ relationship
  and note the amplitude and phase shift
- Express the current mathematically
