# Review

## Complex numbers

## Euler's law
![](./figures/Eulers_formula.png)

## Sinusoidal functions
- Cosine
- Graphical Derivative

## Exercise
- Express the voltage available in a US outlet as a cosine function of
  the form $A \cos \omega t$

## Exercise Solution
- $169.7 \cos 376.8 t$

## Linear Circuit Elements
- Resistors
- Capacitors
- Inductors

# Capacitors

## Capacitors
- Storage device
- Stores energy in an electric field
- Behavior depends on frequency
- Ideal capacitor consumes no power

## Capacitors

## Capacitors
- The capacitance tells how much charge can be stored at a given voltage
- C = Q/V
- Expressed in units of Farads

## Capacitors
- The current is proportional to the time rate of change of the voltage
  applied to the capacitor
- I = C dv/dt

## Exercise
- Based on the relationship $I = C dv/dt$, what is the current in a
  capacitor when hooked up to a DC voltage source?

## Exercise Solution
- The time rate of change of a DC voltage source is zero so the current
  is zero.

## Exercise
- We attach a 10 microfarad capacitor to a 120 Volt RMS source
  represented as a cosine $170 \cos 377 t$
- Sketch the voltage waveform
- Sketch the current waveform based on the $I = C dv/dt$ relationship
  and note the amplitude and phase shift
- Express the current mathematically
