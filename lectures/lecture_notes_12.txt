# Review

## Power Factor
- We can represent any collection linear elements as an equivalent black
  box having a power factor
- Expresses how much of the power is real vs reactive (out of phase)
- $S = VI^*$

## Power factor
- We introduce two new types of power
- S, apparent power
- P, real power
- Q, reactive power

## Complex Power

## Apparent Power
$$ S = VI $$
- RMS voltage times RMS current
- dictates how much current flows from the grid to the load

## Real Power
$$ P = VI \cos \phi $$
- RMS voltage times the portion of current in phase with the voltage

## Reactive Power
$$ Q = VI \sin \phi $$
- RMS voltage times the portion of the current out of phase with the
  voltage

## Power Triangle Example

## Impact on tariffs
- Utilities can charge for power factor less than 1
- Peak kVA charge

## Impact of power factor
- 20% of grid losses
- 1.5% of all electricity


## Power factor correction
- In practice, most loads with power factor less than one are inductive
- We can often correct the power factor by including a capacitor

## Types of loads

### Purely resistive
- Incandescent bulbs
- Toasters
- Space heaters

### Motors
- Pumps for refrigerators and air conditioners
- Power tools
- Blenders, mixers

## Power factor correction example

## High Voltage Capacitor
- 100 kVAR capacitor

## Transformers
- Allow for the simple conversion of AC voltages from high to low or
  from low to high
- Are the reason for the ubiquity of AC distribution
- Use magnetic fields

## Transformers

## Transformers
$$ \frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{N_1}{N_2} $$
- The ratio of voltages is equal to the ratio of turns of wire on the
  transformer sides
