## Announcements

## Upcoming Deadlines

## Demand charges
- Based on peak power consumption during billing period

## Agenda
- Energy efficiency loans


## Review
- Energy efficiency net present value


## Metrics for financial evaluation
- Simple Payback time
- Net Present Value
- Cost of conserved energy
- Cost of avoided carbon
- Equivalent investment (IRR)


## Simple Payback time
- $\textrm{Simple Payback (yr)}= \frac
{\textrm{Extra first cost (USD)}}
{\textrm{Annual Savings (USD/yr)}}$

## Discount Rate and Net Present Value
- Future money is valued less than present money
- $\textrm{Present Value (USD)} =
\frac
{\textrm{Future Amount (USD)}}
{(1 + \textrm{Discount Rate})^{\textrm{number of years}} }$
- $P = \frac {F} {(1 + i)^{n} }$
- Discount rate varies for different situations

## Finance cost
- Allows for the calculation of the annual or monthly payment to repay a
  loan
- Capital Recovery Factor (CRF)
- $CRF = \frac {i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1}$

## Investments

## Case study

## Case study
- Company X uses 90,000 kWh on average each month
- 50% of their use is lighting
- A lighting retrofit gives same light while reducing electricity
  by 25%

1. What is the monthly and yearly reduction in total energy used?
2. Express this as a percentage

<!--
- 45,000 kWh is lighting
- electrical use 45,000 kWh * (1-25%) = 33750
- 45000 - 33750 = 11250
- 33750 + 45000 = 78750
- What is the percentage reduction?  12.5% by multiplying factors
-->


## Case study
- What is the maximum the company is willing to pay for the retrofit?
- What methods of payment do they have?

<!--
- since they are saving 11250 kWh * $0.10 = $1125 per month
- $1125/month * 12 months/year * 1 year = $13500 per year
-->

<!--
- discussion
- how can we compare?
-->

## Case study
- The lighting retrofit will cost $25,000 to install

1. What is the simple payback?

<!--
- discussion
- what are our options to pay for this?
-->

<!--
- 45000 kWh per month is 1500 kWh per day
- if 12 hours per day, average load 125 kW
- if 100 watt light bulbs, 1250 light bulbs
- if we replace 1250 lightbulbs with LED, 1250 * $20 = $25,000
-->

## Case study
- How do we decide to pursue this without a loan?

<!-- questions from NPV example? -->

## Case study
- What if we can get a loan?

<!--
demonstrate favorability with
- interest rate
- capital
- cost of electricity
-->

<!--


- What if they cannot get a loan?
    - we can evaluate using NPV
    - compare the two options for different discount rates

- What if they can get a loan?
    - calculate CCE
    - is monthly payment below avoided energy cost?
    - look at monthly payment for different finance rates and loan
      periods

## Exercise
- What is the annual payment for a $10K loan with an interest rate of 5%
  paid over a period of 7 years?

## Solution
![](./figures/capital_recovery_factor.jpg)

## Real world computation
- Spreadsheet
- Scripting

## Cost of conserved energy
- Allows you to calculate the value of an investment as a per kWh cost
- This allows easy comparison with the current or plausible future cost
  of electricity

## Cost of avoided carbon
- Allows you to calculate the value of an investment as the cost per
  amount of carbon not emitted
- Allows comparison with the current market price of carbon

## Utility Carbon Intensity
- How much carbon dioxide is emitted for each amount of energy generated
- Coal plant about 1000 g CO2 per kWh electricity
- Natural gas about 500 g CO2 per kWh
- Renewables about 10-50 g CO2 per kWh
