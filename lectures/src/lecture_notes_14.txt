## Electric Power Industry


## Generation
- A changing magnetic field in a loop of wire causes a current to flow

## Steam turbines
- Most electricity is created by using a heat source to create steam and
  spin a turbine connected to a generator
- Wind and hydropower do not create steam but still spin a generator

## Grid
- Power generated is fed to a grid

## Grid

## Grid control
- Grid must control for voltage and frequency

## Global electricity
- Approximately 20% of population has no access to electricity

## What fraction of primary energy?
-->

<!--
## Generation

-->

## Electricity prices relatively stable
- Electricity is regulated
- Electricity uses several sources of primary energy


## U.S Electricity Price

## World Oil Price

## Demand

## Load Duration Curve
![](./figures/load_duration_curve.pdf)

## Capacity Factor
- Related to the fraction of time that a plant produces electricity
- Coal and nuclear, about 80% or higher
- Renewables, about 20%

## Load Duration Curve

## Demand
![](./figures/stacked_demand.pdf)

## Efficiency
- Do we build more plants to meet demand?
- Can we use efficiency to avoid demand?

## Screening curve example
- How is the price of electricity determined?
- How do we decide which plants to turn on?

## What fraction of carbon emissions?
- Electricity is responsible for 33% of United States carbon dioxide
  emissions



## Regulated monopolies
- Monopoly franchise
- In return for monopoly rights, business is heavily regulated

## PURPA
- Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978
- Allowed independent power producers (IPPs) to connect to the utility
  grid.
- Encouraged competition
- Guaranteed a market for new power plants

## Decoupling
- Decouples a utility companies profits from the amount of electricity
  sold.

## Electricity
- Invisible
- Indistinguishable
    - Once you put power on a grid, you cannot trace its path
- Immediate
    - Electricity is very difficult to store

## Soft and hard paths
- Centralized electricity is a hard path





## Three phase power

## Three phase power
- Power sent over three wires
- Each wire is 120 degrees out of phase with the others
- For balanced loads, total power transmitted is constant
- For balanced loads, no return wire needed

## Three phase example
- For balanced loads, currents sum to zero

## Three phase example
- Total power delivered is constant
- Allows for smoother operation of machines
