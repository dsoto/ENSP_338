## Discussion
- How old is electricity?
- What are consequences of its discovery?
-->

## First observations of charge
- Ancient Greeks
- Rubbed amber and fur
- Noticed the attraction of lightweight particles

## First observations of magnetism
- Lodestone observations in Greece, India, China.


## What is electric charge?

## Conductors and Insulators
- Conductors have electrons that are mobile
- Insulators have tightly bound electrons

<!--
class exercise
- list some electric conductors
- list some electric insulators
then we'll talk about why
-->

## What is magnetism?
- Magnetic fields can be created by currents or magnetic materials
- [Image of magnetic field lines](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Magnet0873.png)


## Compass
- Observed as early as 200BC by the Chinese
- Navigational use in China about 1000 AD


<!--
how does a compass work?
magnetic field of earth flips every several hundred thousand years
-->

## William Gilbert
- 1600
- Wrote De Magnete
- Credited as one originator of word "electricity"
- Argued electricity and magnetism were distinct

<!--
- believed to have spurred further development in research
-->


## Capacitor
- Capacitors are capable of storing electric charge
- Leyden jar invented in 1744 by Ewald Georg von Kleist

## Battery
- Battery can provide current at a steady voltage
- Demonstrated by Alessandro Volta in 1800 using alternating plates of
  copper and zinc

# Electromagnetism

## Electromagnetism
- The discovery of the relationship between electric current and
  magnetic fields enabled our modern electricity system.
- Motion can be transformed into electric currents
- Electric currents can be transformed into motion

## Compass Needle Deflection
- Observed by Hans Christian Oersted in 1819
- Realized that electric current flowing through a wire creates a
  magnetic field around the wire

<!--
in class demonstration of needle deflection
what we have here is a motor, but it is difficult to get it to rotate
-->

## Ampere's Law
- Quantified the relationship between this circulating magnetic field
  and the current in the wire
- Andre-Marie Ampere, 1820
- $\oint B \cdot dl = \mu_0 I_{enc}$


## Electromagnetic Rotation
- Michael Faraday, 1821

<!--
discuss principle of magnetic induction
-->

## Ohms Law
- 1827
- Georg Ohm
- Ohm's Law
- The current through a conductor is directly proportional to the
  potential difference across the two points.
- $V=IR$

## DC Electric Motor
- Anyos Jedlik
- 1828
- commutator

![](./figures/jedlik_motor.jpg)


## Lenz's Law
- 1833
- An induced electromotive force always gives rise to a current whose
  magnetic field opposes the original change in magnetic flux

<!--
- what is significance of Lenz's Law?
-->

## Maxwell's Laws - 1861
- $\nabla\cdot E = \rho/\epsilon_0$
    - Electric field lines begin on charges
- $\nabla\cdot B = 0$
    - No magnetic charges
- $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}$
    - Changing magnetic field generates an electric field
- $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\left(\mathbf{J} + \varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}} {\partial t} \right)$
    - Electric current creates a magnetic field


## Remnant DC system
- San Francisco has DC grid to power old elevators

## AC Electric Motor
- Ferraris
- Nikola Tesla
- 1885

## First Electric Vehicle

## Three Phase Electric Power
- Late 1880s
- Galileo Ferraris
- Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky
- Nikola Tesla


## Pearl Street Station
- Operated by Edison Electric in 1882 in Manhattan
- Used a DC Generator and steam engines

## AC vs DC current
- DC championed by Thomas Edison
- AC championed by George Westinghouse

<!--
- class exercise
- does everyone understand the difference between DC and AC?
- think through major electrical appliances in your home
- do you know which loads in your home are fundamentally AC or DC?
-->

## Transformer
- 1884 ZBD Transformers

![](./figures/zbd_transformer.jpg)

## Transition to Widespread Electrification
- By 1930, 70% of households were electrified
- Rural Electrification Administration established in 1935

## Transistor
- 1947
- Bardeen, Brattain, Shockley
- Enabled the electronics and computer revolution

## Lighting
- 1880's sees the first commercialization of incandescent light bulbs
  after years of research
- Title III of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007
  effectively bans the use of incandescent light bulbs

## Deregulation
- Electricity monopolies were dismantled
- California Electricity Crisis 2000-2001

<!--
class exercise
should electricity be private or public
why or why not?
-->

## Renewable Portfolio Standards
- California Assembly Bill 32
- Mandates reductions in greenhouse gas emissions

## Electricity Contribution Environmental Problems
- Acid Rain
- Climate Change

## Financing Innovations
- Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE), 2008
- Sonoma County had first county-wide program in the nation
- Solar Lease, Power Purchase Agreement
