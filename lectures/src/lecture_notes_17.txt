# Three phase power

## Three phase power
- Power sent over three wires
- Each wire is 120 degrees out of phase with the others
- For balanced loads, total power transmitted is constant
- For balanced loads, no return wire needed

## Three phase example
- For balanced loads, currents sum to zero

## Three phase example
- Total power delivered is constant
- Allows for smoother operation of machines

## Phase and line voltages

- Phase voltages are the voltages on each wire with respect to ground
- Line voltages are the voltages between lines
- We can show that the relationship between the amplitudes is
$$ V_{line} = \sqrt{3} V_{phase} $$

$$ Vac = Va - Vc $$


## Proposals
- Is the question to be answered clear?
- Is it clear why the question is important?

## AC to DC conversion

## Non-linear elements
- Diodes allow one-way current flow
- Transistors are electrically controlled switches
