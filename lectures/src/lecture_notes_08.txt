<!--
use pats lecture notes lecture 10
use figures from gils book
can use rigol folder for real current voltage sweeps
look in lab books around aug 2011 for what i was doing
-->

## DC vs AC
- What does 120V mean?

## Motivation
- Most electricity uses alternating current
- Understanding the mathematics is necessary to understand the
  implications of alternating current

## What frequency is US electricity

<!--
Use multimeter to measure voltage
-->

## Sine and Cosine Review

## Ohms Law
- $V = IR$
- $V = V_m \cos(\omega t)$


## Power
- $P = VI$
- $P = V_m^2/R \cos^2(\omega t)$
- This is the instantaneous power.
- We are instead interested in the average.

## RMS

## Complex Numbers Review
- $i = \sqrt{-1}$

## Complex Plane

## Representations of sinusoidal signals
- sinusoids
- phasors


<!--
most of this lecture was on the whiteboard
-->

## Exercise

## Instantaneous power


## RMS

## Power Factor
- Line losses increase to provide the same power at low power factor.

<!--
demonstrate that when you get out of phase, you must deliver more
current to get the same average power.
