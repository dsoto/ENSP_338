# Review

## Transformers
- Allow for the simple conversion of AC voltages from high to low or
  from low to high
- Are the reason for the ubiquity of AC distribution
- Use magnetic fields

## Transformers
$$ \frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{N_1}{N_2} $$

## Transformer exercise
- what is the turns ratio for stepping down from 4kV to 240V?


# Three phase power

## Three phase power
- Power sent over three wires
- Each wire is 120 degrees out of phase with the others
- For balanced loads, total power transmitted is constant
- For balanced loads, no return wire needed

## Three phase example
- For balanced loads, currents sum to zero

## Three phase example
- Total power delivered is constant
- Allows for smoother operation of machines
