# Concepts

## Idealized circuit representation
- Lines have no resistance and uniform voltage
- Real elements (heaters, filaments, batteries) are represented as ideal
  models

## Kirchhoff's Current Law
- The sum of currents flowing into a node must equal the sum of the
  currents leaving the node at any instant.
- Water flow or automobile traffic provide some intuition.

## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law
- The sum of the voltages around any loop of a circuit at any instant is
  zero.
- Hiking a trail provides some intuition.

## Ideal Voltage Source
- An ideal voltage source can deliver any amount of current while
  holding its voltage constant.

## Ideal Resistor
- An ideal resistor obeys Ohm's Law, $V=IR$

## Ideal Current Source
- An ideal current source delivers a fixed amount of current no matter
  the voltage at its terminals

## Equivalent resistances
- We can use Ohm's Law and Kirchoff's Laws to determine an equivalent
  resistance to model a network of resistors.

## Resistors in series
- Resistors in series have the same current flowing through each one

## Resistors in parallel
- Resistors in parallel have the same voltage across their terminals

## Relationship to energy
- One coulomb of charge raised to a potential of one volt gains one
  Joule of energy

## Relationship to power
- Voltage is energy per charge
- Current is charge per time
- Voltage times current has units of energy per time or power
- $\frac{energy}{charge} \cdot \frac{charge}{time}$
- $P = VI$
