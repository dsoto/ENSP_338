<!--
need to begin with a conceptual introduction to the concept of the time
value of money that transitions into a quantitative treatment.  need to
come up with a way to make the equivalence of present value and future
value.

## Metrics for financial evaluation
- Simple Payback time
- Net Present Value
- Cost of conserved energy
- Cost of avoided carbon
- Equivalent investment (IRR)


## Simple Payback time
- $\textrm{Simple Payback (yr)}= \frac
{\textrm{Extra first cost (USD)}}
{\textrm{Annual Savings (USD/yr)}}$

## Discount Rate and Net Present Value
- Future money is valued less than present money
- $\textrm{Present Value (USD)} =
\frac
{\textrm{Future Amount (USD)}}
{(1 + \textrm{Discount Rate})^{\textrm{number of years}} }$
- $P = \frac {F} {(1 + i)^{n} }$
- Discount rate varies for different situations

## Exercise
- What is the limit of the present value of a payment far in the future?

## Solution
- As the number of periods grows large, the denominator grows large and
  the present value tends towards zero.
- $P = \frac {F} {(1 + i)^{n} }$

## Exercise
- Does the present value of a future payment increase or decrease with
  an increasing discount rate?

## Solution
- As the discount rate increases, the denominator increases and the
  present value decreases.
- $P = \frac {F} {(1 + i)^{n} }$


## Exercise
- What is the present value of a future payment if the discount rate is
  zero?

## Solution
- The present and future value are equal in the case of a zero discount
  rate
- $P = \frac {F} {(1 + i)^{n} }$

## Exercise
- You will receive a series of payments over the next three years.
- Year 1, $100
- Year 2, $200
- Year 3, $300
- At a discount rate of 10%, what is the present value of these
  payments?

<!--
- why is this different than $600?

## Finance cost
- Allows for the calculation of the annual or monthly payment to repay a
  loan
- Capital Recovery Factor (CRF)
- $CRF = \frac {i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1}$

## Exercise
- What is the annual payment for a $10K loan with an interest rate of 5%
  paid over a period of 7 years?

## Cost of conserved energy
- Allows you to calculate the value of an investment as a per kWh cost
- This allows easy comparison with the current or plausible future cost
  of electricity

## Exercise
- What is the limit of CRF for very high interest rates?
- What is the limit of CRF for very low interest rates?

## Exercise
- What interest rate allows for the lowest monthly payments?

## Cost of avoided carbon
- Allows you to calculate the value of an investment as the cost per
  amount of carbon not emitted
- Allows comparison with the current market price of carbon

## Utility Carbon Intensity
- How much carbon dioxide is emitted for each amount of energy generated
- Coal plant about 1000 g CO2 per kWh electricity
- Natural gas about 500 g CO2 per kWh
- Renewables about 10--50 g CO2 per kWh

## Exercise
- Calculate the cost of conserved energy when replacing an incandescent
  with an LED light bulb.
