# Review

## Complex Impedance
- The analysis is the same as for purely resistive but we use complex
  voltage, current, and impedance.

## Complex Impedance Example
- Based on REEPS2 Ex. 3.5


## Power Factor
- We can represent any collection linear elements as an equivalent black
  box having a power factor
- Expresses how much of the power is real vs reactive (out of phase)
- $S = VI^*$

## Power factor
- S, apparent power
- P, real power
- Q, reactive power

# Power Factor

## High Voltage Capacitor
- 100 kVAR capacitor

## Power Factor
- Power factor close to unity gets apparent power as low as possible

## Impact of power factor
- 20% of grid losses
- 1.5% of all electricity


## Impact on tariffs
- Utilities can charge for power factor less than 1
- Peak kVA charge
