# ENSP 338 Homework Number 1

Due Date:	September 16, 2013

1. Your Basic Toaster Oven

    a. A toaster oven has a resistance of 24$\Omega$.  At a voltage of 120V,
    what is the current through it, and how many watts of power does it
    draw?

    b. Repeat for a toaster oven with a resistance of 12$\Omega$.

    c. Assuming it takes 1 minute to toast two pieces of bread using the
    toaster oven with a resistance of 12$\Omega$, and electricity costs
    \$0.13/kWh, what is the cost of the electricity used to toast two
    pieces of bread?

    d. Explain in your own words why a load with lower resistance draws
    more power.

2. Your Basic Bulb

    a. An incandescent light bulb is rated 40W at 120V.  What is its
    resistance in ohms, and what is the current?

    b. Repeat for an incandescent light bulb rated 60W.

3. Your Basic Battery

    a. A battery can deliver 100 amp-hours (Ah) at 12V.  How much stored
    energy does it have, in kilowatt-hours?  In joules?

    b. Find a rechargeable battery. Note its charging voltage and
    amp-hour capacity, and calculate the stored energy in kWh and J.
    Based on your observation of how many hours it takes to charge this
    battery when depleted, estimate the charging current in amperes and
    charging power in watts.

4. 	Shocking Science

    a. While fixing a light in Germany, Prof. von Meier accidentally
    touched a hot wire at 220V.  What would the resistance of her shoes
    (which we assume to be the most significant resistance in the
    circuit) have to be so that the current through her body would not
    exceed 50 milliamps (mA)?

    b. Why is it inadvisable to perform electrical work while standing
    in a puddle of water, and 	why are wooden ladders preferable to
    aluminum?

    c. Why do electricians touch their pinkie to the wall while touching
    a wire with their thumb?

5. 	Extrapolating from your PG&E bill

    Find a recent PG&E bill for your house or a friend's.

    a. 	Estimate the total connected load in this residence, and think
    about the typical times for which appliances are used.  Does the
    bill make sense?

    Example: Bathroom lights, 150W * 3 hrs/day * 30 d/mo = 13.5 kWh/mo

    Hair dryer, 1000W * 5 min/d * 30d/mo * 1 hr/60min = 2.5 kWh/mo

    Electric toothbrush charger, 4W * 24h/d * 30d/mo = 2.8 kWh/mo

    Total bathroom = 19 kWh/mo

    Carry out this estimate for your whole house.

    b. From the total billed monthly electric energy (kWh) consumption,
    calculate the average rate of power consumption in watts.

    c. Based on things you know (U.S. population, etc), estimate the
    average rate of electric power consumption in the United States, in
    multiples of watts.

    d. Convert the average figure from c. into kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year.

    e. On the internet, see if you can verify that you got the correct
    order of magnitude in your estimate in d.
