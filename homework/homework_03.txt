# ENSP 338 Homework 3

Due Date:  Mon 14 Oct 2013

The problem set you turn in should be both legible and the methods and
assumptions you are using must be clear.  I strongly suggest that
you use diagrams where appropriate and clearly state your assumptions.
Typesetting of problem sets can increase the readability.  The homework
will be graded on the clarity of the method as much as the correctness
of the result.


## Problem 1

Your Basic Transformer

A step-down transformer is connected between Phase A and neutral on a
distribution circuit that has a nominal (phase-to-phase) voltage of 21
kV.  The turns ratio of the transformer is 50:1.

State your answers to two significant figures.

a. What is the rms voltage on the secondary (customer, low-voltage)
side of the transformer? (5 pts)

b. Suppose the customer's load is 14.4 kW.  What is the current on the
primary (high-voltage) side of the transformer? (5 pts)

c. Which wires need to be thicker: those on the primary or secondary
side? (5 pts)

d. Sketch a diagram that explains how one could use the same transformer
with a different connection to also provide 120V service. (5 pts)

## Problem 2

Transformer, More Realistic

A transformer has 250 turns on the primary and 50 turns on the secondary
winding.  The transformer is 96% efficient, so that 4% of the power
entering on the primary side is converted to heat.

a. If this transformer is supplying a purely resistive load of 10 kW at
120V on the secondary side, what is the current in the primary winding?
(10 pts)

b. Explain how the answer would differ if the load still measures 10kW of
real power, but is not purely resistive. (10 pts)

## Problem 3

Draw a power triangle labeling the angle, the side of the triangle
that represents real power, the side of the triangle that represents
apparent power and the side of the triangle that represents reactive
power.

a. Assume that a given load has reactive power that is equal to 30 kVAR
and real power equal to 60 kW, calculate the power factor and show your
work and the equations that you use. (5 pts)

b. Calculate the apparent power associated with the values specified in
part a. (5 pts)

c. In part a. above, the reactive power is a positive number.  What type
of load (inductive, capacitive or resistive) produces a positive
reactive power. (5 pts)

d. What type of load can be added to the load described in a. to reduce
the reactive power? (5 pts)


## Problem 4

a. (5 pts)

b. (5 pts)

c. (5 pts)

## Problem 5

a. (5 pts)

b. (5 pts)

c. (5 pts)

## Problem 6

## Problem 7
Please estimate the amount of time you spent on this homework. (5 pts)
