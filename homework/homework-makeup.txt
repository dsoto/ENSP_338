# ENSP 338 Homework Makeup Assignment



You can turn in a supplement to your homework for partial credit on the
points missed.
If you scored a one or a two on the original homework problem, you may submit a
reflection on that problem for up to one point of credit.  You may do
this for as many problems as you like on the homework.

This goal of this assignment is not to demonstrate a correctly worked
problem.
The goal instead is to show that you understand the conceptual or
computational mistake that you made by describing the nature of your
error.
The second step is to describe what you've done to account for this to
improve your performance in the future.

For example, if I incorrectly answered a problem because I
incorrectly used my calculator, I'd say that that was a computational
problem and that I was practicing with my calculator
to be sure I got it correct in the future.

In another problem, I might have misunderstood the difference between
power and energy or series and parallel.  In this case, I would say that
I had a conceptual problem distinguishing between power and energy and
that I've been studying the difference and creating a list of examples
of each.

To receive full credit, the self-analysis should be both clearly worded
and match your issue.  You will hand in the original problem set as
well.  It is much more important that you correctly identify your issue
(for your own benefit) than that you turn in a corrected version.  As we
stress in this class, the method you used to get an answer is as
important as the answer.

Please make this easy to evaluate by clearly indicating which problem you are
describing and what your original score was.

<!--
clearly indicate how many points you lost and the points you are
applying for.
