This is an ungraded problem set to see where your background skills are.
Please answer these questions to the best of your ability.  The results
will help me adapt my teaching to the class's background.  Please also
show enough work for me to see your thought process.


\problem{}

If $\phi$ equals 30 degrees and $a$ equals 10, what is the value of
$$ a\sin\phi\cos\phi $$

\solution{
Substitute given values and evaluate
$$ 10 \sin 30 \cos 30
= 10 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.866
= 4.33 $$
}

\problem{}

If $f = 60$, $t= 1$ and $\phi = 0.785$, what is the value of
$$ sin(2\pi f t + \phi) $$


\problem{}

If $r_1 = 10$ and $r_2 = 20$ what is the value of
$$ \left(\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2}\right)^{-1} $$


\problem{}

If $r = 0.02$ and $n = 10$, what is the value of
$$ \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n} $$

\solution{
Substitute given values and evaluate
$$ \frac{1}{(1 + 0.02)^{10}}
= \frac{1}{(1.02)^{10}}
= \frac{1}{1.22}
= 0.82 $$
}



\problem{Spreadsheet}

Using your Seawolf google docs account, create a Google Docs
spreadsheet entitled exactly ``338-HW-0''.  In the first
column of the spreadsheet, create the numbers 0 through 10.  In the
second column, create a formula that multiplies each of these numbers by
two.  Share the spreadsheet with me at my address (sotod@seawolf).

\problem{Time Spent}

Please estimate the amount of time you spent on this homework.
