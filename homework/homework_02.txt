# ENSP 330 Homework 2

Due Date:  Wed 17 Oct 2013

## Problem 1

### Gauging the Wires

Peruse the tabulated data in the Wikipedia articles on American Wire Gauge and
Electrical Resistivities of the Elements.

a. From the resistivity of copper, and from the wire dimensions in the AWG
table, confirm the resistance of 12-gauge copper wire, in ohms per kilometer,
that is listed in the table.  Show your work, which will include unit
conversions.  Assume room temperature.

b. Calculate the resistance of 12 AWG aluminum wire in ohms/km at room
temperature. Why is copper preferred over aluminum conductor, even though it is
more expensive?

## Problem 2

### Voltage Drop

A 2 ohm resistor is connected to a power source 100m away, with 12 AWG copper
wire. The current is 10A. What is the voltage across the resistor, and what is
the voltage supplied by the power source?


## Problem 3

### Christmas Lights

a. Consider a string of Christmas lights with 50 bulbs connected in series.
The voltage across the entire string is 120V.  What is the voltage drop across
each individual bulb?

b. If each bulb draws 4W, what is its resistance?

c. What is the current through each bulb?

d. Through the entire string?


## Problem 4

### The curse of the extension cord

The following appliances are found in a studio kitchen: a 600 W toaster, 3
lights @ 100 W each, and a 800W microwave oven (which you may assume to behave
like a resistor). Assume a nominal voltage of 120V ac.

a. Will a single 15A circuit be able to handle all these loads operating at the
same time?

b. What is the resistance of each load?

c. Suppose all these appliances are plugged into a power strip at the end of a
long extension cord. The cord has a resistance of 0.2 ohms. How much power is
dissipated in the cord? Do you think this might be a problem?

d. What is the voltage drop in the extension cord? If the voltage at the outlet
is exactly 120.0V, what is the voltage seen by the loads?

e. How much power does each appliance actually draw under these conditions?

## Problem 5

Name two reasons why an AC power grid with transmission voltages of several
hundred kVolts and residential service at 120 -- 240 V AC is better suited to a
national power grid than a DC system with generation at 600 Volts and
residential service at 24 Volts.
