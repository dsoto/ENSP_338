# ENSP 338 Research assignment

The purpose of this assignment is for you to research a topic of
interest to you and determine its potential to make an impact on our
electrical energy system.
You have freedom in the
selection of your topic.  My main criteria are that

1. The project is interesting to you
2. You provide a rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis
3. You provide a clear explanation of your work

Many of you will be doing this sort of work throughout your careers and
I want to give you practice in this.

We will pursue this project in multiple steps including a brainstorming
phase, an outline, a rough draft, a final draft, and a presentation.
This is to simulate the way work is often done in professional settings.
I'm hoping that this project and what you learned can be a topic of
discussion in your job interviews in your near future.

## Learning objectives
- Practice examining an energy issue from multiple perspectives
- Practice making quantitative estimates in energy problems

## Groups

You may work in groups of up to two if you like.  Your group must be decided
by the time you submit the outline.

## Null Result

It is not important when you choose the topic that it will have clear
benefits.  You may find during the course of your research that your
topic does not have very compelling benefits.  The recommendation may
then be that your policy not be pursued or that more research is
necessary to determine the true benefit.

# Milestones

## Brainstorm topic

Brainstorm a list of at least three possible topics on your own.
This is to get you thinking early in the process.  You will turn these
in via Moodle.

## Outline

When you turn in the outline, you will need to have chosen teams and a
topic.  This outline will clearly explain the topic, what exploration
you will do and how you will accomplish it.  It should be about one to
two pages in length.  The outline will be submitted via Moodle as a
single PDF file.

Unexcused late submissions will lose 10 points for each day they are
late.

## Outline feedback

I will generate a random set of readers for each project.  These
students will read the outline and provide feedback on it.  This
feedback will be guided by a rubric that I will provide that helps you
identify the aspects of a good outline.


## First draft

You will turn in a first draft of your proposal.  This should be fairly
complete but may have some rough spots.
This report will contain a written part with an introduction, a
description of your methods, a summary of your results, and a discussion
of the implications of your result.  You will also include either in the
text or as an appendix, the details of your calculations.  The written
portion should be at least 1000 words in length.  Accompanying the first
draft will be a short description of how you incorporated the feedback
from the outline into your report.

### Submission
The report will be submitted via moodle as a single PDF file.
Unexcused late submissions will lose 10 points for each day they are
late.

## First draft feedback

In professional
environments, any work you do will be submitted for review and revision.
We will simulate this by sending it to the same peer reviewers that read
your outline.  They will read it and give you feedback on

1. Is the report well structured and does it contain an introduction,
   method description, and discussion of implications?
1. How can the calculations be made more clear?
1. How can the explanation of the calculations be made more clear?
1. Are there any mistakes in the calculation?

If you don't have any suggestions for improvement, you must point out
which aspects of the project are strongest and why.

### Submission
You will submit your feedback via Moodle so that the instructor can view
it.  You will also provide a copy to your classmates using whatever
method you prefer.

## Final report

The final report be the same format as the first draft and will also
include a rebuttal saying how you incorporated the
feedback from the peer reading.

### Submission
Ideally, you will turn in a single PDF file with your report.  If this
is too difficult, you may also
submit your spreadsheets or any supplementary files to Moodle.
Unexcused late submissions will lose 10 points for each day they are
late.


### Grading
Your projects will be graded according to the following criteria

- Overall organization of report
- Clarity and communication of your quantitative analysis
- Accuracy of the quantitative analysis
- Clarity of writing


## Final Presentation

You will present your work in class explaining your topic, your
analysis, and your results.  Presentations will be approximately 10
minutes and will leave time for about 5 minutes of questions.

### Submission

In addition to the in-class presentation.  There will be a Moodle link
for you to upload a PDF of your slides or materials.

### Grading
Your presentations will be graded according to the following criteria

- Clarity of presentation
- Use of visual aids
- Preparation
- Organization
