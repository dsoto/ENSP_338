# Project Suggestions

This is a list of topics to consider for your class project.

## ETC
- How much energy would a lighting change from fluorescent to
  light-emitting diode lighting save the Environmental Technology
  Center?
- Would a different rate plan (such as time-of-day pricing) save the ETC
  on the cost of electricity?

## Campus electricity
- What opportunities for electrical energy savings exist in the lighting
  on campus?  The motors for HVAC?  Are there other opportunities you
  can identify?

## Energy
- How much energy could be generated on campus using our available
  rooftops?  How much would this cost?
- What strategies are available to reduce carbon from single vehicle
  trips on campus?  How effective are they?
- What overall investment is needed for universal energy access?  How
  does this compare to our current spending?
- What is the current kg CO2 per full time equivalent student on the
  Sonoma campus?  what is the largest component?  How could this be
  reduced?
- What are the carbon footprint contributions of the entire Sonoma State
  Campus?  (travel, electricity, water, goods, human respiration)  What
  should priorities be for mitigation?

## Electric Vehicles
- What emits less carbon, cooking with induction, resistive electrical,
  or natural gas?  Which is cheaper?
- What would be the carbon reduction from a complete electrification of
  all cars coming to campus?  What would it cost to install enough
  vehicle stations to do this?
- How much would electricity generation have to increase if all
  passenger cars became electric?

## Energy Access
- What is the minimum level of energy to get a high level of service?
- What does energy investment need to be to achieve it?

## Water
- What percentage of campus water is used by students in the dorms?
  What percentage is used by landscaping.  What could be done to reduce
  use in either of these?

## Food
- Is it better from a CO2 or cost perspective better to have factory
  farmed stuff driven a long distance in an efficient truck or locally
  produced organic materials in a less efficient truck?

## Climate Protection Campaign Questions
- How can Sonoma County accelerate the electrification of the
transportation sector? Who needs to do what?
- What financing is available
and/or needs to be created to accelerate vehicle electrification?
- Can Sonoma Clean Power contribute to these electrification efforts? If so,
how?
- Should we retrofit existing combustion engine vehicles to be
electric and/or encourage buyers of new vehicles to choose electric?
- What audience should be targeted to go electric?
- Is going electric
really a GHG reduction strategy when the embodied carbon in vehicle
production is considered?
- For what carbon intensity of electricity will electric vehicles emit
  less carbon dioxide per mile?
- What are the barriers to electrifying the
transportation sector and how can we overcome them?

## Sonoma County Water Agency Questions

1. What is the most effective way to reduce the ecological impact (and
   GHG impact) of personal transportation choices?  Factor in cost per
   GHG ton reduced.  Consider urban planning, behavior based programs,
   peer pressure, automobile technology, etc.

2. What is the water carrying capacity of Sonoma County based on current
   and projected population?  And what large scale agricultural water
   conservation programs and projects could be put in place to meet
   future water needs, esp. if droughts continue?

3. Campus water use assessment:
a. How many toilets are there on the SSU campus?
b. How many of those are low flow toilets?
c. How many gallons of water would be saved if all the toilets on campus were low flow?
d. Are there working aerators on all water fixtures on campus that can receive an aerator?
e. How much water savings potential is there?

4. Office Parks and office campuses typically use turf grass as a major landscaping effect.
a. How much water is used by office campus landscapes and how can campus managers routinely measure that consumption?
b. Is there a cost-effective alternative to using turf?  Include cost to replace turf and balance cost savings by using less water against cost to maintain the alternative.  Measure comparisons over a period of time.
c. Can public agencies influence the decision of campus managers?

5. How do students/faculty/staff get to and from campus/school/class: walk, private cars, bikes, carpools, mass transit, other?
a. Chart (pie-chart?) transportation modes used to get to and from school?
b. Chart (pie-chart?) energy consumed over a period time.
c. Chart ghg emissions over same time.
d. Can energy consumed/emissions produced be changed?  How? Who would lead?  How?

6. Is there a carbon sink on campus?
a. Can the on campus carbon sink be defined?  If so define it.
b. Can it be quantified?  If so quantify it?
c. Can it be improved?  If so, how.  If not, why not.

7. For Rohnert Park (within city limits):
a. How many homes/businesses have solar installed?
b. Given an "average" installation, what is the potential solar production for Rohnert Park?
c. What is the current market penetration?
d. How much energy is produced/could be produced at 80% market penetration?
e. How many additional tons of CO2 could be avoided 80% market penetration was achieved?

8. What is the percentage of the SSU campus that still has opportunity for zero
   scape?

9. What would a 5-year plan look like for SSU buildings to optimize Solar on
   available structures?

10. What are 10 ways SSU can be an energy resource for the public?

11. How many miles does the average SSU student drive each week and what is the
    average GHG emissions from that activity? What incentives would cause
    students to drive less in order to achieve a 25% reduction in GHG?

12. How much does a sampling of students pay for their car each – fuel,
    insurance, car payment, parking, etc.? What opportunities (new car
    financing, car share, etc.) would be the most financially beneficial to
    students to get them to shift from their current vehicle to an electric or
    electric hybrid vehicle?

    Compare your current levelized cost per mile of transportation to other alternatives.

13. How much electricity does the average student use each day – in buildings,
    charging electronic devices, watching TV, gaming, etc.? How is this energy
    paid for – directly or indirectly? How much does it cost?

14. Using the materials from class such as ENSP 403 Computer Modeling, model
    the highest energy use building on campus and identify the highest return
    on investment improvements that could be made.   Include cost, savings and
    emission reduction in the analysis.

15. Monitor desk appliance use and provide feedback to the subjects and
    evaluate changes in use based on feedback availability.  Kill-A-Watt team?

16. What would the impact be to the grid, campus energy use, and policy of 50%
    of the cars on site were plug-in electric 5 years from now?

17. What is the energy use profile for Sonoma County attributable to change in
    population from 2000 to 2030?
