title: Project Outline Description and Rubric
---

The project outline is an important part of the writing process that
allows you to lay out a high-level design of your report without getting
lost in the details.

This outline should make each of the following things clear

- What is the central question you hope to answer
- What method will you use to answer your question
- What evidence are you going to provide

A suggested framework for your outline is

- Introduction
    - explain to the reader why this topic is worthy of investigation
    - clearly state the question that you are answering
- Method
    - tells the reader how you intend to answer your question
    - will you be gathering data?
    - will you be making calculations?
- Results
    - what are the results of your investigation and analysis
    - these may not be clear at the beginning but you can take some
      guesses
- Implications
    - what does your finding suggest?
    - should we but more effort, money, or research into this idea?
    - should this idea be ruled out?
- Conclusion

Your final report does not need to follow this outline exactly.  It is
an activity to help you organize your thoughts and efforts.  Your paper
may very well stray from the outline after you do more work and
research.  The outline should be about 1 or 2 pages in length.


# Rubric

This provides some guidance on how these outlines will be graded.

## Strong (3 pts)

A strong outline will make it clear to the reader what question is being
posed and how that question will be investigated.  The reader will have
a clear idea what smaller questions will be answered to contribute to
the larger question.

## Acceptable (2 pts)

An acceptable outline will make it clear what will be covered in the
report but will not necessarily make it clear how those topics relate to
the overall goal of the paper.

## Unacceptable (1 pts)

An unacceptable outline will not be well organized and will not give the
reader a clear idea of what question the paper will answer.  It may also
be very short.
